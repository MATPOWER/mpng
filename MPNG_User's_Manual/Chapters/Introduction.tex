\section{Background}

\mpng{} is a package of \matlab{}~\cite{zimmerman2011,matpower} for solving optimal power and natural gas flow problems. \mpng{} uses the general user nonlinear constraints capability of \matpower{} to model the gas network taking into account: gas-fired power generators, storage units, wells, power-and-gas-driven compressors, and nodes with stratified demand (different market segments get different priorities). The \mpng{} source code can be found at:

\noindent \mpng{} was developed by Sergio~García-Marín~\footnote[1]{{\tiny Universidad Nacional de Colombia - sede Manizales\label{foot:UNAL}}} and Wilson~González-Vanegas~\footnote[2]{{\tiny Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira\label{foot:UTP}}} under the direction of Carlos~E.~Murillo-S\'anchez~\footref{foot:UNAL}. The initial need for a \matpower{}-based power and natural gas optimal flow package was born out of a project aimed to analyze the integrated operation of the Colombian power and natural gas systems.\footnote[3]{{\tiny Project number 1110-745-58696, funded by Colciencias, Colombia.}}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\mpng{} is a \matpower{}-based~\cite{zimmerman2011,matpower} package for solving optimal power and natural gas flow problems. \mpng{} uses the general user nonlinear constraints capability of \matpower{} to model the gas network taking into account: gas-fired power generators, storage units, wells, power-and-gas-driven compressors, and nodes with stratified demand (different market segments get different priorities). The \mpng{} source code forms part of the \matpower{} project and can be found at:

\noindent \mpng{} was developed by Sergio~García-Marín~\footnote[1]{ Universidad Nacional de Colombia - sede Manizales.\label{foot:UNAL}} and Wilson~González-Vanegas~\footnote[2]{ Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira.\label{foot:UTP}} under the direction of professor Carlos~E.~Murillo-S\'anchez~\footref{foot:UNAL}. The initial need for a \matpower{}-based power and natural gas optimal flow package was born out of a project aimed to analyze the integrated operation of the Colombian power and natural gas systems.\footnote[3]{ Project number 1110-745-58696 funded by Colciencias, Colombia.}

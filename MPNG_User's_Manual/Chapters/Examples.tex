\chapter{Examples}
\label{chap:examples}

In this section, we provide some examples to show the main capabilities of \mpng{} for simulating the operation of power and natural gas networks. We have included the folder \mpngcasepath{} in the distribution, which contains the gas and interconnection cases used for testing. Moreover, the folder \mpngexamplepath{} contains the files used in the examples. In particular, we explore two examples: (1) the integrated operation of a nine-bus power system (\code{case9\_new}) and an eight-node natural gas grid (\code{mgc\_case8}); and (2) the single operation of a 48-node looped natural gas network.
